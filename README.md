# SQL Data Analytics Project

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for **data exploration, analytics, and reporting**.

These scripts cover a wide range of analysis types, including:

- Database exploration
- Measures and metrics analysis
- Time-based and trend analysis
- Cumulative and ranking analytics
- Segmentation and performance analysis
- Customer and product reporting

Each script is designed to **explore, segment, and analyze** data within a **relational database**.  
The project demonstrates **best practices** for writing efficient, modular, and readable SQL queries for real-world data analytics.
